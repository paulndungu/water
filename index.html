                <p>Water is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colourless chemical substance that is the main constituent of earth's water supply such as streams, lakes and oceans together with seas. Water is also the main constituent in most living organisms. Water is found at room temperature in liquid state.</p>

                <p>Water covers 71% of the earth's surface. It is vital for all known life forms. On earth, 96.5% of the planet's crust water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in groundwater and the ice caps of antarctica and greenland, a small fraction in other water bodies and 0.001% in the air as vapour, clouds and precipitation.</p>

            <p>Water is a polar inorganic compound. Water is nearly colourless with a hint of blue. This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances.</p>

             <h3>States.</h3>
                </div>
            <p>Water is a liquid at room temperature and pressure. At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.</p>

            <h3>Pressure.</h3>
                </div>
            <p>Increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the boiling point, that is about 374 degrees celsius at 220 atm. At very low pressures of below 0.006 atm, water cannot exist in liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by sublimation. At very high pressures of above 221 atm, the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called supercritical steam comes into being.</p>

                    <p>The apparent colour of natural bodies of water(and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids, or by reflection of the sky, rather than by the water itself.</p>

<!--                    <div class="p8">-->
                    <p>Light in the visible electromagnetic spectrum can traverse a couple meters of pure water(or ice) without significant absorption, so that it looks transparent and colourless, thus aquatic plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because sunlight can reach them. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.</p>

<!--                    <div class="p9">-->
                    <p>Through the thickness of 10 meters or more, however, the intristic colour of water(or ice) is visibly turquoise(greenish-blue) , as its absorption spectrum has a sharp minimum at the corresponding colour of light. The colour becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness. Infrared and ultraviolet light, on the other hand is strongly absorbed by water.</p>

                    <p>The refraction index of liquid water(1.333 at 20 degrees celsius) is much lighter than that of air(1.0) similar to those of alkenes and ethanol, but lower than those of glycerol(1.473) and benzene(1.501). The refraction of ice(1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.</p>

<!--                    <div class="p11">-->
                    <p>Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms, it is a polar molecule, with an electric dipole moment(oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive.</p>

<!--                    <div class="p12">-->
                    <p>Water is a good polar solvent that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol. Most acids also do dissolve in water to yeild the corresponding anions. Many other substances in living organisms such as proteins, DNA and polysaccharides, are dissolved in water. Gases like oxgen and carbon dioxide are also dissolved in water.</p>

                <p>Hydrology is the study of  the water movement, distribution and quality throughout the earth. The study of the distribution of water is hydrography. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology.</p>
                <p>The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere. The majority of water on earth is sea water.</p>

                <h3>Water cycle.</h3>
                <p>The water cycle(known as the hydrological cycle) refers to the continous exchange of water within the hydrosphere, between the atmosphere, soil water, surface water, groundwater and plants. Water moves perpectually through each of these regions in the water cycle consisting of following transfer processes:
                    -evaporation from oceans and other water bodies into the air and transpiration from land plants and animals into air.
                    -precipitation from water vapour condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.
                    -runoff from the land usually reaching the sea.
                    Most of the water vapour over the oceans usually return back to it, but winds carry water vapour over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea.</p>

                    <p>Sea water contains about 3.5% of sodium chloride on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differs from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower (-1.9 degrees celcius) and it's density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing.</p>
                    <p>Tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the moon and the sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams.</p>
