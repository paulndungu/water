On earth, 96.5% of the planet's crust water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in groundwater and the ice caps of antarctica and greenland, a small fraction in other water bodies and 0.001% in the air as vapour, clouds and precipitation.</font></p>

            <p><font size="4">Water is a liquid at room temperature and pressure. At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.</font></p>

            <p><font size="4">Increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the boiling point, that is about 374 degrees celsius at 220 atm. At very low pressures of below 0.006 atm, water cannot exist in liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by sublimation. At very high pressures of above 221 atm, the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called supercritical steam comes into being.</font></p>

Water moves perpectually through each of these regions in the water cycle consisting of following transfer processes:
                    -evaporation from oceans and other water bodies into the air and transpiration from land plants and animals into air.
                    -precipitation from water vapour condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.
                    -runoff from the land usually reaching the sea.
                    Most of the water vapour over the oceans usually return back to it, but winds carry water vapour over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea.</font></p>

                    <p><font size="4">Sea water contains about 3.5% of sodium chloride on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differs from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower (-1.9 degrees celcius) and it's density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="4">Tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the moon and the sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams.</font></p>
